# ![Icon](./.bluemix/secure-lock-kubernetes.png) Develop a Kubernetes app in hybrid cloud


### Develop a secure Docker app in public Cloud for staging and private Cloud for production 
This Hello World application uses Docker with Node.js and includes a DevOps toolchain that is preconfigured for continuous delivery with Vulnerability Advisor, source control, issue tracking, and online editing, and staging deployment to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) and final production deployment to IBM Cloud Private (ICP) or an 
Openshift Container Platform (OCP).

Application code is stored in source control, along with its Dockerfile and its Kubernetes deployment script.
The target cluster is configured during toolchain setup (using a IBM Cloud API key and cluster name). You can later change these by altering the Delivery Pipeline configuration.
Any code change to the Git repo will automatically be built, validated and deployed into Kubernetes clusters.

### Prerequisites

You need to get a non expiring token to deploy continuously into your prod Kubernetes cluster.
This typically is accomplished using a permanent service account token that will be used by pipeline to deploy.

As a cluster administrator, you need first to connect to the prod cluster:
- Connecting to IBM Cloud Private (ICP)
  - See [also](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/fe25b4ef-ea6a-4d86-a629-6f87ccf4649e/entry/Configuring_the_Kubernetes_CLI_by_using_service_account_tokens1?lang=en)).
  - Log in to your private cluster management console. Also see [Accessing your IBMÂ® Cloud Private cluster by using the management console](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0/manage_cluster/cfc_gui.html?view=kc).
  - Select User Name > Configure client, which is in the upper right of the window.
  - Copy and paste the configuration information to your command line, and press Enter 
- Connecting to local Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - Launch docker desktop, ensuring kubernetes is enabled
  - `kubectl config use-context docker-desktop`
- Connecting to OpenShift Container Platform such as an online cluster (https://manage.openshift.com/)
  - In cluster console, select User Name > Copy Login Command
  - Copy and paste the configuration information to you command line, and press Enter

#### Find cluster master address/port

- Run command `kubectl cluster-info` will show these information. E.g. 
```
Kubernetes master is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```
Cluster master address is here `kubernetes.docker.internal` and port is `6443`.

#### Creating namespace

- Create target cluster namespace if not already existing, ie. with command line: 
```
CLUSTER_NAMESPACE=prod
kubectl create namespace ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}
```
- If the target is an OCP, use instead:
```
CLUSTER_NAMESPACE=prod
oc new-project  ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}
```

#### Creating service account

- Either create a specific service account in cluster, or leverage the existing `default` service account as instructed below to retrieve its token.
  - For an OCP cluster, use the `oc` CLI:
    ```
    oc project ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=default
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$(oc serviceaccounts get-token $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME)
    echo ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN}
    ```
  - For other Kubernetes clusters (such as ICP):
    ```
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=default
    SECRET_NAME=$(kubectl get sa "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" --namespace="${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}" -o json | jq -r .secrets[0].name)
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret ${SECRET_NAME} --namespace ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} -o jsonpath={.data.token} | base64 -D)
    echo ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN}
    ```

#### Grant admin permission to service account

- Ensure admin permission for chosen service account in specific namespace:
```
# grant admin permission (rbac)
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cd-admin --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} 
```

- If target is OCP cluster, instead use the following to scope in specific namespace only:
```
# grant admin permission (rbac)
kubectl create rolebinding cd-admin --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --namespace=${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}
```

#### Get permanent token for service account
- Copy and save the value of `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, it will be needed for later configuring pipeline in IBM Cloud public

### Tutorial steps
1. Setup this hybrid toolchain demonstrating how to build/test in IKS and deploy into private cluster (e.g. ICP or OCP)
2. See 'prod' deploy failing because cannot connect from IBM Cloud public into private cluster target
3. Setup a pipeline private worker in that ICP cluster
4. Re-run the pipeline and see the prod deployment stage succeeding
